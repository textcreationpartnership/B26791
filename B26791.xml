            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <q>A <hi>Common-wealth</hi>'s the thing that Kingdoms want.</q>
            <p>But woe the time! That the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> should suffer themselves to be Corrected and <hi>Underlay'd</hi> by so Artless a Wight! Howbeit, that this is his grand <hi>Bent,</hi> conspicuously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the many daring <hi>Scandals</hi> he constantly is casting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sundry Illustrious <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and on several of the <hi>Sacred Order.</hi> View his <hi>Chronology</hi> of this Year, 1692. and observe how he deals by <hi>K.

<pb facs="tcp:206043:3"/> the Rebels (<hi>non obstante</hi> their Godly Pretences) design'd not his Re-establishment, nor to make him a <hi>Glorious King,</hi> as they promised; their aim being at the <hi>Ruin</hi> of his <hi>Honor, Crown</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> As you may find by reading his own <hi>Excellent Book:</hi> Also by <hi>Sir W.

               <hi>Merlini Liberati Errata:</hi> OR, THE PROPHECIES and PREDICTIONS OF <hi>John Partridge.</hi> For 1690, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With some Brief Notes upon them.</head>
            <p>AS the Worthy Author of <hi>Cometomantia,</hi> and others very Learned, give their <hi>Suffrage</hi> for <hi>Astrology,</hi> on condition it were separated from the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Falshoods</hi> it is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made to Patronize: In the same Sense do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>own</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it. When I meet with Railing and Reviling Language in Books treating of the <hi>Stars,</hi> I look on them only as <hi>Glasses</hi> wherein to see <hi>Devils;</hi> and their Authors to be as far distant from the Philosophy of the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of either. I shall therefore keep my self within the bounds of <hi>Verity</hi> in my <hi>Examen</hi> of <hi>J. P</hi>'s <hi>Almanack</hi> for 1690, lately come to my hand: And if in any thing I deviate from this prescribed <hi>Rule,</hi> it will be only when constrained thereunto by some monstrous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of the Author I have to do withal. And methinks I already find many begin to Pity me, in relation to this undertaken Task. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dura nimis est ingenuae cum Meretrice contestatio.</hi> It is a difficult Task for an <hi>Honest Woman</hi> to Combate it with a <hi>common Scold;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Argument,</hi> she shall meet with nothing but <hi>Huff, Claw</hi> and <hi>Ruffle.</hi> Albeit, for the sake of <hi>Urania,</hi> I have at all this <hi>Brutish Odds,</hi> cast aside my serious Reservedness for a time, to entertain a <hi>Literary War</hi> with one that under pretence of Art, runs on <hi>Railing</hi> at all sorts of Persons, not sparing <hi>Crowned Heads, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. Nor yet the <hi>Master</hi> that taught him; and thinks to bear all down before him with <hi>Clamorous Noise</hi> and <hi>Impudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:206043:4"/>
            <p>In his Epistle to this <hi>Almanack</hi> of 1690. he accosts us with a very uncouth Passage, <hi>viz. This little Book will run the whole Nation thorough.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Tool,</hi> it seems as Sharp as its <hi>Author,</hi> and all out as Dangerous. The Nation had best be provided of a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> lest it Languish of the Wounds design'd it by this terrible Sir <hi>Guy. To run the whole Nation thorough,</hi> is a mighty Task, such as none of the best Masters of <hi>Defence</hi> dare attempt. No! 'tis our blustring <hi>Partridge</hi> is the only <hi>Gladiator</hi> in Fashion, and can <hi>Run Nations thorough!</hi> So that those single Persons he is pleas'd to wound, are Honour'd by this daring <hi>Dueller of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> He formerly contended with <hi>Universities,</hi> and now's become a Combatant for <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> What will this <hi>Don Quixot</hi> come to at last? Let the <hi>Wind-Mills</hi> beware of him.</p>
            <p>But passing the quaintness of his <hi>Stile,</hi> I will now make himself Judge, Whether it had not been better and truer <hi>English,</hi> to have said, <hi>This Book shall run thorough the Nation,</hi> than that it should <hi>Run the whole Nation thorough?</hi> This later being a ridiculous <hi>Menace;</hi> the former carrying in it some savor of <hi>Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the conclusion of his <hi>Epistle,</hi> he threatens to be a <hi>Goad in his Masters side, as long as he Lives:</hi> A most grateful Resolution! And yet within a few Lines affirms, <hi>He knows no cause of a Difference.</hi> Sure the Man is Acted by the <hi>Devil,</hi> to deal thus by <hi>him,</hi> that hath done more for him than ever his Parents were able, and unto whom he ought constantly to be paying <hi>Duty.</hi> But I shall leave him to be accounted with for this, by the <hi>Person he threatens;</hi> who will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requite him as he deserves, if the thoughts of an <hi>Impar Congressus</hi> prevent not. But alas! if all his <hi>Goads</hi> were <hi>Awls,</hi> his <hi>Tutor</hi> need not to put on <hi>Mabury</hi>'s <hi>Bodies</hi> to secure him from the Danger. So I pass from his <hi>Epistle,</hi> to what he calls, <hi>His Monthly Judgments.</hi>

'Tis wonder he did not <hi>make</hi> one, as well as <hi>Predict</hi> it. He hath been well known to many <hi>Plot-makers,</hi> viz. <hi>Tongue, Mansel, Hunt,</hi> &amp;c. But here's the Mischief on't, <hi>Partridge can't Ride!</hi> as 'twas <hi>Sworn</hi> against him in the History of the <hi>Rye-House Conspiracy.</hi> But leaving this, he tells us of a <hi>Town taken by Surprize.</hi> Of which Town so Taken, none ever hear'd. This therefore must pass for one of his <hi>Airy Castles.</hi>âHe assures us, that â <hi>Stationary on theâAscendant, and in â¡ of his M. C. gives him loss of Honor, Treachery,</hi> &amp;c.âI will not contrast it with him, whether loss of <hi>Honor,</hi> &amp;c. be a <hi>Gift?</hi> Tho <hi>Gain</hi> is commonly opposed to <hi>Loss;</hi> yet were I as the <hi>Native</hi> he mentions, I would desire â if he have no other Favours to <hi>bestow,</hi> to keep them to himself. But, what if â hath not given such <hi>Loss of Honor,</hi> &amp;c. as this Man talks of? And is not within 4 Deg. of the <hi>Horoscope</hi> he mentions, and near 3 <hi>times 4 distant from a â¡ to the M.

               <p>Now our <hi>Merlin</hi> breaths forth mighty things, and tells usâ<hi>That the â â â¿ in â is of eminent Service to the Affairs of</hi> Britain. And why so? Because <hi>Britain</hi> is under â <hi>Ergo</hi> a â â â¿ in â must Befriend them. I have heard of a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> that pretended to Cure the <hi>Gout</hi> in the great Toe, by laying a Plaister to the <hi>Nose:</hi> Bet saith our <hi>Seer, the â¡ â â¿ doth give the Undoing of a Merchant or Banker,</hi> &amp;c. [A Pox of its Courtesie, may the Merchant or Banker cry] and the â â â <hi>gives danger of Death to a Great Lady. And the â â â gives danger of Death by reason of the Gout, to some great and eminent Man,</hi> &amp;c. Pray who of any Sense, would say, Thank ye for such Gifts? To the <hi>Merchant</hi> or <hi>Banker</hi> ready <hi>Cash</hi> had been better; to the <hi>Great Lady,</hi> a <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>Six;</hi> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206043:5"/> the <hi>Great Man, Claret</hi> and <hi>Good Company</hi> had been Presents more Welcome. But for such kind of <hi>Gifts</hi> as this <hi>Man</hi> makes the Planets to deal among <hi>Mortals,</hi> none are obliged to them. To be serious, in what <hi>Author</hi> doth our <hi>Merlin</hi> meet such a <hi>Term of Art,</hi> as for the <hi>Planets to Give?</hi> Astrologers tell us, that <hi>Planets</hi> may <hi>Presage,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,</hi> &amp;c. But for to <hi>Give,</hi> is no Astrological Phrase; nor have the <hi>Planets</hi> any <hi>Hands</hi> given them for any such Purpose.</p>
               <p>To Expostulate a little with our liberal <hi>Merlin,</hi> Why should the â â â <hi>give Death to a Great Lady?</hi> It falls in Friendly terms; and which of them doth signifie the <hi>Great Lady?</hi> If â she is strong and preserves Life. If â he's Peregrine, and cannot signifie a <hi>Great Lady.</hi> Surely he Dream't of some <hi>Sybil of the Kitchin,</hi> who upon the loss of her <hi>Corydon</hi> might grow <hi>Crop sick</hi> upon that â â â for such a one might pass with him for a <hi>Lady Great,</hi> or a <hi>Great Lady;</hi> to use one of Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s Tropes to him, his Conversation reaching but very little higher. And why should an â â â, <hi>Give danger of Death by the Gout?</hi> Since like the former, it is made from saluriferous parts of Heaven. But I put too great a Price upon an <hi>Ass's-head,</hi> when I expect Reason thence to issue.</p>

                     <hi>Of his Eclipses</hi> Anno 1690.</head>
                  <p>And the first he tells us, <hi>Is of the</hi> â February 28, <hi>at Ten at Night, in the last part of</hi> â; and yet confidently affirms in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> that the <hi>New â½ was at Eleven o Clock at Night.</hi> As if the Eclipse and New â½ had been two different <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s. But hang an Hour among Friends! It can make odds in his Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He says this Eclipse <hi>Gives damage to Rivers and Fountains, and all things therein,</hi> &amp;c. (I have reckon'd with him formerly for the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Stars.) He Quotes <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for this Donation; but the words are not <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s, but <hi>Proclus</hi>'s. But <hi>Proclus</hi> may be <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy Proclus,</hi> 'tis all one to our Battavian <hi>Merlin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Eclipse he says, <hi>Is of the â½, on</hi> March <hi>14th. at Ten at Night; at which time almost three parts of the â½'s Body will be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Almost we say, saves many a Lye; but it will not do so here: For all the Annual Writers, except himself, who undertake to determin the <hi>Eclipsed Digits,</hi> affirm, that not one half of the â½'s Body would be <hi>Obscured.</hi> And so indeed the Event proved. And the <hi>Author</hi> from whom <hi>Partridge</hi> Pilsers this Eclipse doth not determin the quantity of Darkness. So that it is apparent, he writes thereof
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206043:9"/> at Random, and not by Skill. Can you believe without a serious Examination, that a Man so empty of Art should be so full of Impudence! But let the hollow Tub Sound; that's all 'tis good for.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, <hi>The Third Eclipse is of the</hi> Sun, August 24, <hi>about One in the Morning, in</hi> 11 â and brings in <hi>Junctine</hi> to say,â<hi>It gives Famine, Plague, Sedition,</hi> &amp;c. But good Sir, shew us where <hi>Junctine</hi> says so! Of himself we are sure he says no such thing. But <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi> whom he Quotes, doth say, <hi>when the â shall be Eclipsed in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano Secundo â famem, pestem,</hi> &amp;c. But our <hi>Merlin</hi> as blind as a Mole, can't see when his Author speaks of himself, or from another. He proceeds,â<hi>It gives Destruction to Mankind, because it is in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sign.</hi> And in this he hath shewn his Skill, <hi>viz.</hi> In placing the Energie of this <hi>Eclipse</hi> upon Men, that himself being <hi>Brute</hi> all over, might happily escape the Danger.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, <hi>Is of the</hi> â½ September <hi>the 8th, at Two a Clock in the Morning,</hi> (as he says) <hi>in</hi> 26 â, of which he makes <hi>Junctine</hi> to say, <hi>It threatens Poets,</hi> (and they, saith he, <hi>of all Men, have the least need of it;) and gives Banishment and Slaughter.</hi> A very formal Story! But where doth <hi>Junctine</hi> say this upon an Eclipse of the â½ in 26 â. Sure you your self are turn'd <hi>Doggrel Poetaster,</hi> that can thus forget and <hi>Feign</hi> at pleasure. The Man hath only mistaken the Judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, (not of <hi>Junctine</hi>) but of <hi>Proclus</hi> on a <hi>Solar Eclipse</hi> in 26 â, for those of a <hi>Lunar</hi> one in â (this being such) as is plain to any that reads <hi>Proclus,</hi> as Quoted by <hi>Junctine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lo! what an All sufficient Astrologer have we here! Certainly if ever any Man deservedly came under the <hi>Poets Lash,</hi> our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent <hi>Merlin</hi> merits to run the <hi>Gantlope</hi> through them all. I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pity the Disciples of this insolent Fellow, (if at least he have any;) to think how sadly and Extravagantly they'll be Taught; this their Tutor being so brim full of Ignorance, and withal so empty of all true Art and English.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206043:9"/> And (1.) He observes as idly as Ironically.â<hi>An excellent Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion for Mischief to a great Person in</hi> Ireland; <hi>and that is â ad â â, per Arcum Obscurum.

Then for that quaint term of Art, <hi>of his measure of time to Expire;</hi> I perceive his <hi>Measure of time</hi> is not <hi>Immortal,</hi> but must Die even as its Author. Whereas, a true <hi>Measure of Time,</hi> is as Immortal as <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>But, (3.) He makes a bustle about <hi>Hopes and Fears,</hi> &amp;c. But I must tell him, we value neither his <hi>Hopes or Fears;</hi> nor yet shall we trouble our self with what he appoints â <hi>to do with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful</hi> French-man, (as he wittily phrases it) having as little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for any of <hi>England</hi>'s Enemies, as any Addleheaded <hi>Merlin</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

            <p>SInce the Writing hereof, I am informed, That <hi>non obstante</hi> our <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Menaces to <hi>Monsieur, &amp;c.</hi> (and let him heap upon him as many hard Presages as he can, for me, I shall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned thereat.) This is that very <hi>J. Partridge</hi> who in 1680 <hi>flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> so much on his behalf; then Publishing his <hi>Nativity,</hi> which was Printed by <hi>N. T.</hi> by the token it was never yet paid for.</p>
            <p>In that Nativity Page 15, he thus Writes, <hi>That â casting â¶ to his Horoscope, makes him perform all his Actions with greatness and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory, suitable to the quality of his Birth, And that â½ in â â and â within Orbs â¶ â affords him divers admirable Qualifications, and so lofty a Spirit, that he scorns to trample on a Conquer'd Enemy. And Page 17, 18. The Natives Enemies are signified by â in â â½ near the Presope and Aselli, in â â and â¡ â: And therefore for his publick Enemies abroad, the â â infatuatet them, and possesseth them of many strange Fears; so that they are but like a Lyon in a Lambs skin, having the name, but not the nature of Enemies. And Page 19. The â well placed in the Tenth House, gives great Power: to which we may add the â¶ of â to â, and to the Cusp of the</hi> M. C. <hi>almost, with the Cor Leonis, a Regal fixed Star Culminant. All which are Arguments of Honor and Splendor, and that to his Lifes end.</hi> Thus <hi>Partridge</hi> Flatteringly Scribled, 1680.</p>
            <p>Now, what strange Misfortune hath blinded his Understanding, that he could not call this to mind before he had wrote his opposite Predictions hereunto? But his business is not to study <hi>Self-Consistency,</hi> and therefore hath made one of his <hi>Babel</hi> Works a <hi>Glass</hi> to the rest, wherein they appear with their Heels upward.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>I</hi> say once more, let him lessen <hi>England</hi>'s Enemies as much as he can, so he proceed upon just and laudable Measures, in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I</hi> shall really be of his side. <hi>I</hi> own it my Duty to Serve our King and Country, even to my utmost ability, either in <hi>Purse</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> or both, and this <hi>I</hi> resolve cordially to do against any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Enemy, either Abroad or at Home. While this <hi>Partridge</hi> notwithstanding all his Boastings, under pretence of a counterfeit Duty to it (if he dare own his own words) in bauling Anti monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, (<hi>A Commonwealth's the thing that Kingdoms want</hi>) Doth muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously Clamour against it And <hi>I</hi> can't hear he ever Recanted this <hi>Treasonous Republican Position;</hi> the which he ought most fully to do, if he would be thought a Friend to the <hi>English Monarchy,</hi> or a true Subject to the thrice Valiant and Warlike present Sovereign thereof: Whom God long Preserve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>AS Parting between Friends, is attended with some ardent Valediction, so shall mine be with <hi>J. P.</hi> 'Tis pleasant to note how he labours to acquit himself from a Contradiction he own'd. 1690. <hi>He knew no ground of a Difference with his Tutor:</hi> And now in 1693, pretends to find one. The Fellow, Jugler like, plays <hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Loose;</hi> we know not where to have him. In the Epistle to his <hi>Mene Tekel, 2d</hi> Part. He owns a Conversation with Mr. <hi>G.</hi> from 1665. to 1680. And then (says he) <hi>The Strangeness began about Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi> (A wrethed Lye!) If the Quarrel, or Strangeness began in 1680, and upon so strange a ground too: It is strange it should not beknown to him in 1690. And if it was known to him in 1690, (which he both <hi>Owns</hi> and <hi>Disowns:</hi>) Then his pretended Ground thereof in 1693, pickt out of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him in 1687, is a meer Prevarication, and like himself, without <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Conscience.</hi> And yet therein he complains of many ill-sounding <hi>Epithets</hi> cast on him in that <hi>Reply;</hi> and some of them no less than 158, or 160 times over. (That <hi>Reply</hi> sticks in his Stomach.) Now will I really abate him 150 in either Sum, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he'll make the residue good. But the Man makes Lyes his Refuge. And for the Epithetes he musters up, had his <hi>Provocations</hi> been set by them, they would have appeared <hi>Roses,</hi> and not <hi>Thorns:</hi> And yet it is hard to Cope with a dirty black-thumb'd Author, and not contract some of his Filth. None that touch Pitch can 'scape Defilement, in <hi>tanto,</hi> at least.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Merlin</hi> is much troubled at an <hi>Anagram</hi> which Visits the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and would fasten it upon <hi>J. G.</hi> as the Author.

               <p>â I Am to acquaint my Reader, that <hi>I</hi> have just now met with a New Piece of <hi>J.</hi> P's <hi>Astrology,</hi> as like the <hi>Dad</hi> as ever it can stare; It rather excels, than falls short of his other <hi>Bedlam</hi> Prints in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> loud <hi>Railing,</hi> and superlative <hi>Impudence, &amp;c.</hi> yet demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates his <hi>Nurses</hi> care of him in his <hi>Infancy;</hi> for it appears he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pen</hi> nor <hi>Tongue</hi>-ty'd. He is so bold herein, as to denounce a War, not only against the <hi>Person that first taught him to get his Bread,</hi> but also against almost all <hi>Astrologers,</hi> both Ancient and Modern. So that you see, this <hi>Terrae Filius,</hi> is ashamed of nothing, be it never so Ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Albeit, (tho by his many idle Concessions, and obvious Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, he hath Answer'd himself.) Yet, <hi>I</hi> dare engage, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he first disrobe his beastly <hi>Tract</hi> of all its Railings against <hi>Religion, Kings, Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> &amp;c. and Re-print it in such a Dress as may shew him a Man that deserves some reasonable notice, he shall have a <hi>Reply.</hi> But for a <hi>Beast</hi> that Brays! and a <hi>Bedlamist</hi> that Raves! can any one that is <hi>compos Mentis,</hi> think such fit for any Sober Man to Cope with? He must be a grand Enemy to <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> both, that shall Prostitue either to any irrational or unwarrantable Purpose.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> (the only Man that rais'd him to what he is) I am of an Opinion, he's wiser than to be concern'd with his great heap of <hi>Billings gate Stuff,</hi> but will rather own himself overcome by his <hi>Ribaldry</hi> than <hi>Reason;</hi> and Silenc'd more with his <hi>Acrimony</hi> than <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi> And for the wicked Scandals wherewith he Defames Mr. <hi>G:</hi> had they been true, how comes it that he hath escaped the Law all this while?
